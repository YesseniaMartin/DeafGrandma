# DeafGrandma

### Description

When was the last time you visited your sweet old grandma? It's been a minute and she misses you so much. Let's create program where we talk to grandma but she can only hear you if you SHOUT/response in capital letters.

Make sure grandma can hear you.

Remember, the program end when you leave your grandma house in this case when you say/SHOUT "GOODBYE" to grandma.

### Technologies Used
The program "DeafGrandmaApp" is launch when our main(); method call our DeafGrandmaApp.
In our launch(); I created the user prompt where you have to addressed your sweet grandma.
Used a scanner(System.int) for the user response and instantiate my Grandma class.
A boolean was needed to have the while loop meeting the condition true;
The public class Grandma has two methods canGrandmaHearyou(); and grandmaResponse(); in side each method a random phrase is being called.
There's an array holding 5 phrases and each time time that method is called a random phrase will be return.

### Lessons Learned
Start small. Drink water and forget about coding when you need a break!!!

Push new changes into Github when new code is created.

Keep drinking water and make time to complete a step at a time.

Re-learn to be patience.
